** Features
*** TODO [#A] Events: revise the event sources and event handling

There seem to be two paths of event handling, with MacOSX events being
delivered directly to views thru MclGui, and some other events being
delivered thru get-next-event.

Check that all events (key, mouse, etc) and all modifiers are
correctly transmitted where they must go.

*** TODO [#A] Delivery: debug de/serialization of wrapper/NSObjects save-image.
*** TODO [#A] Windows
*** TODO [#B] Dialog Items
*** TODO [#B] Dialogs
*** TODO [#B] Midi: revise midi stuff, and restructure it: midiplay redefines methods.
*** TODO Pathnames: revise the handling of pathnames, Mac pathnames, logical pathnames, loading libraries, resources, saving images.
*** TODO [#B] Quickdraw
*** TODO [#B] Views
*** TODO [#C] Fonts
*** TODO [#C] Clipboard
*** TODO [#C] Apple Events

Apple Events are only used for external scriptability: aesend is only
called from send-appleevent, which is only called from record--ae et
al. in recordables.lisp

Therefore this todo is not prioritary at all.
