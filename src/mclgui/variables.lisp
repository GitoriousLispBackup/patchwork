The *MULTI-CLICK-COUNT* variable is incremented during event
processing if the current event is part of a series of multiple
clicks. It is reset to 1 when there is a mouse click that is not part
of a series.

Determination of whether a click is part of a series is done as for
DOUBLE-CLICK-P.

The *CURRENT-EVENT* variable holds the event record currently being
processed.  This is bound by EVENT-DISPATCH and is valid only during
event processing.

The *EVENTHOOK* variable provides a user hook into the event system.
A program can store a function of no arguments in this global
variable.  The stored function is given the first opportunity to
handle all event processing.  If the function returns true, the event
system assumes the event has been handled and no further processing is
done.  If the function returns NIL, the event system assumes the event
hasnâ€™t been handled and the normal event handlers are invoked.

The *IDLE* variable signals the event system that the main Lisp
process is idle. This changes the sleep time that event dispatch gives

Controls the interaction of break loops and WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS.  If
set to true, a break loop can occur during a without-interrupts.  The
WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS is suspended for the duration of the break loop.

The *arrow-cursor* variable specifies the standard north-northwestarrow
cursor shape.

The *i-beam-cursor* variable specifies the I-beam shape used when
the cursor is over an area of editable text.

The *watch-cursor* variable specifies the watch-face shape shown
during time-consuming operations, when event processing is disabled.
")


(defvar *cursorhook* nil
  "
The *CURSORHOOK* variable may be bound to a function or cursor, giving
you complete control over the appearance of the cursor.  This variable
is bound by WITH-CURSOR.

If the value of this variable is non-nil, then no other cursor
functions are called.  If the value of *CURSORHOOK* IS a function, it
is called repeatedly in the background and has complete control over
the state of the cursor at all times.

If it is not a function, it should be a cursor record or a 'CURS'
resource ID.

Its initial value is an internal function that allows events to alter
the cursor normally.

;; Scrap:

(defvar *scrap-state* nil
  "
The *SCRAP-STATE* variable contains a list of scrap types and
indicates which types currently have a valid scrap.  This variable is
modified by calls to PUT-SCRAP.
")


(defvar *scrap-handler-alist* nil
  "
The *SCRAP-HANDLER-ALIST* variable contains an association list of
scrap-type keywords and scrap-handler objects.  Initially, this
association list has three entries (one for :TEXT, one for :FRED, and
one for :LISP).  If you define new scrap handlers, you should add
entries for them to this list.

  "
The *LISP-STARTUP-FUNCTIONS* variable contains a list of functions of
no arguments on which funcall is run after Macintosh Common Lisp
starts, just before it enters the top-level function (usually the
Listenerâ€™s read loop).  The functions contained in
*LISP-STARTUP-FUNCTIONS* are run after the functions specified by
DEF-LOAD-POINTERS and before the init file is loaded.  The functions
are called in reverse order from the order in which they appear in the
list.

(defvar *lisp-cleanup-functions* '()
  "
The *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS* variable contains a list of functions of
no arguments on which funcall is run just before Macintosh Common Lisp
exits (via QUIT or SAVE-APPLICATION).  These functions are called just
after the windows are closed.

When saving an application, the functions in *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS*
are run, then the functions in *SAVE-EXIT-FUNCTIONS* are run.
")

(defvar *save-exit-functions* '()
  "
The *SAVE-EXIT-FUNCTIONS* variable contains a list of functions to be
called when an image is saved.  These functions should perform any
preparation necessary for the image saving.  The functions are called
in the order in which they appear in the list.

When saving an application, the functions in *LISP-CLEANUP-FUNCTIONS*
are run, then the functions in *SAVE-EXIT-FUNCTIONS* are run.
